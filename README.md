I made this project with FortniteAPI to practice. I tried to follow best practices and tried to write clean code as much as i could. Learned so much in this project. 

I found the api from this website -> fortniteapi.com

I made Infinite Scroll for Items page. There was almost 2000 data and i dont want to render them at once. Thats why i needed to make infinite scroll. I did use "react-infinite-scroll-component". 

I practice in this project:

#Javascript
#ReactJS - ReactJS Hooks
#Bootstrap
#Responsive Design
#CSS
#AJAX/JSON

 Thank you.
